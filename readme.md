# 5b

[5b](http://ray33ee.github.io/5b) allows hundreds of conversions from within a quick and simple UI.

Instead of using websites for each conversion, or having to create one-off code, 5b can be used to convert and display types. 

Common conversions, between lower bases (hex, binary, octal, decimal), higher bases (base64), prmitive integers, as well as more obscure conversions
between string types (utf8, utf16, C escaped, percent escaped), unix date, 24-bit color and UUID are all supported!

But nevermind all this waffle, try it out for yourself! Just type in a string, tell 5b how you want it to interpret that string by selecting the possible type,
then watch as 5b lists all possible conversions.

Ever wanted to convert an IPv4 address to base64? No? Well [here](http://ray33ee.github.io/5b?input=192.168.0.1&selected=IPv4) it is anyway. Tired of manually escaping those pescy regexes? Use 5b to [do it](http://ray33ee.github.io/5b?input=%5Cb\(%3F%3A%5B0-9%5D%7B1%2C3%7D%5C.\)%7B3%7D%5B0-9%5D%7B1%2C3%7D%5Cb&selected=UTF-8%20String) for you!
